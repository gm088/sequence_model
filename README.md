The aim here was to provide primary sequence features that distinguished one group of sequences from the other. 
Supervised; the sequences are binary classified.
sequence is one-hot encoded
Uses Keras API for tensorflow
2D convolutional NN

uses integrated gradients method to estimate importances of nucleotides in sequence
