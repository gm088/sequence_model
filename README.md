# 2-D convolutional neural network for deciphering sequence features discriminating two groups of sequences

## Description
Tensorflow
Grid search for optimal paramters
importance calculation using Integrated gradients
Visualise importances

## Misc

* Based on [DeepRiPe](https://github.com/ohlerlab/DeepRiPe) 
* Some functions taken from [Neural Network DNA demo](https://github.com/const-ae/Neural_Network_DNA_Demo)
* Feature importances estimated using [Integrated Gradients method](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365)
